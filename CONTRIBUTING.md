## Code of Conduct:

This project adheres to a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report any unacceptable behavior on Discord (e.g. to katniss218).

## Soft Contributions:

#### Reporting Issues/Bugs:

If you found a bug, please report it by opening a `bug` type issue on [HSP GitHub](https://github.com/Katniss218/HumanSpaceProgram/issues).
Please include information on how to reproduce the bug:
- A clear and concise title describing the problem.
- A description of the expected vs. actual behaviour.
- The steps that can be taken to reproduce the problem.
- The `log.txt` file.

Note that the log.txt is cleared whenever the game starts up. :)

#### Enhancements and Features:

Enhancements are always welcome and appreciated! If you have a suggestion on how to improve Human Space Program for everyone, you can suggest it by opening an `improvement` or `new feature` type issue on [HSP GitHub](https://github.com/Katniss218/HumanSpaceProgram/issues).
Please include information on your idea:
- A clear and concise title describing your suggestion.
- A detailed description of the suggestion.
- A brief explanation on why you think it's needed.

Note that "improvement" is for existing systems, and "new feature" is for new features ;)

## Development:

Before you decide to start working on a feature, **please check in with me**. Chances are I can give you valuable information on how a system can be implemented in a way that will mesh well with the rest of HSP and with HSP's design philosophy.

Human Space Program is held to a high standard in code modularity and flexibility, as this makes future work on the project as well as writing mods easier.

#### Forking and Pull Requests:

If you're not a contributor on the repo, you can fork the repository to start working on a feature to be later merged.

- **Fork the Repository** - Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page.
- **Create a Branch** - Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive name, such as `feature/noninertial_reference_frames` or `bugfix/atmosphere_renderer_depth_buffer`.
- **Make Changes** - Implement your changes in the new branch.
- **Commit Changes** - Commit your changes, ideally with clear commit names.
- **Create a Pull Request** - Open a pull request to the main repository, detailing your changes and linking to any related issues.

#### Style Guides:

Human Space Program's code style is derived from [Microsoft's C# style guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions). The primary difference is in whitespace settings around parentheses/braces that will hopefully make the code a bit more readable.
Each csproj project comes with an existing .editorconfig file that contains the code style.

## Mods:

If you prefer not to contribute to the main repository, another excellent way to enhance Human Space Program is by developing game modifications (mods).
By creating mods, you can add new functionalities and improve the game experience in different ways without changing the base game.

Mods are also written in C#, just like the main game. :)

## Getting Help:

If you have any questions, feel free to join [Human Space Program creator's official Discord server](https://discord.gg/w9JqtxM3Tw)

## Acknowledgements:
