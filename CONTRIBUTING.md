Dunno what to put here, other than, if you want to work on a feature / PR, please please please consult it with me, for the sake of your own time mostly. 
I already have a vision of how certain systems should be implemented, have thought of potential problems, solutions, etc.
I also have relatively high standards for the code itself, so again, for the sake of your own time, it would be nice to check in with me periodically.
