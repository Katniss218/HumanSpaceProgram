## Scope:

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including but not limited to the github repository, discord server, and any future communication spaces not listed here.
It also applies to people representing the project in public spaces. Don't be an ass. ;)

## Expected Behavior:

All participants are expected to:

- Be collaborative. Work together to resolve conflicts and promote overall kindness.

## Unacceptable Behavior:

The following are some examples of unacceptable behaviours:

- Harassment
- Abuse
- Intimidation
- Disrespectful behaviour, being an "asshole" in general

The following are **not** examples of unacceptable behaviours:

- Respectful disagreements on different topics
- Brief or "blunt" responses, although discouraged, are not forbidden.
- Jokes, if everyone involved is okay with them.

## Reporting Guidelines:

When reporting, please include:

- Who is being reported
