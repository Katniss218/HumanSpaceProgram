# HSP's Intended Gameplay Loop:


- The player starts with an initial spaceport.

- The first thing you will probably do is to start designing your first rocket.

- After you've done that, you can use the "construct" tool to place it in the world (on the launchpad), and drive the starting cranes to it, so it starts being constructed.
    You can timewarp to when the rocket is constructed.

- You will need to fuel your rocket. To do so, use your fuel pickup point to buy propellants (it will be "transported" to it by the supplier)
    Some propellant tanks may come fuelled, but they are heavier

- After that you can pump it into the rocket.

- And after the rocket has been fuelled, you can launch it.



- You can construct buildings that will build more things for you.
