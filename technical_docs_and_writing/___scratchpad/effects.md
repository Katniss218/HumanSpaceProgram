# Effects

particles (particle systems)

audio

meshes (reusable meshes with driveable material properties)
- static or rigged (skinned)
- bone positions/etc driven by drivers and stuff
- maybe anim support later (due to unity limitations it needs a custom anim lib that supports runtime loading of animation files)


lights (pooled lights for engine lighting and lighting of other effects)
- positions and other properties driven by drivers, as with meshes
