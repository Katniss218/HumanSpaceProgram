## Introduction:

Human Space Program aims to create a realistic spaceflight game with hopefully a relatively low barrier of entry (comparatively speaking) that is easy to mod.

If you like Kerbal Space Program, you will also like this.

#### Features:

- **Free of charge** - HSP is and will forever be available for free for everyone.
- **Open source** - Contribute to the project.
- **Modular rockets** - Build rockets from parts, which themselves may consist of even more parts.
- **Real scale systems** - The Earth, the Solar System, and real world-sized rockets.
- **Modular design** - Easy to write mods for.

## Installation:

#### Prebuilt Binaries:

You can download prebuilt binaries from the [releases section on GitHub](https://github.com/Katniss218/HumanSpaceProgram/releases). Simply download the appropriate file for your operating system, extract it, and run the executable to start playing.
There is no installation process - simply unzip and double-click on the executable. :D

#### Unity Editor:

If you prefer to build HSP from source or want to contribute to its development, follow the steps below:

**Prerequisites:**
- **Unity Editor** - Version 2022.1.8f1 (*as of 2024/07/10*). HSP will transition to Unity 6 sometime in the future.
- **Git or a Git client** - To clone the repository.

**Steps:**
1. Clone the repository or download as ZIP.
2. Download the Unity Editor:
    - Download and install Unity Hub from the [Unity website](https://unity.com/download).
    - Use Unity Hub to download the Unity Editor version specified above.
3. Press the "Add Project" button and locate the directory containing Human Space Program. Note that it's **not** the repository's root directory.
4. Select and open the project in Unity Hub.
5. Once the Unity Editor finishes loading, navigate to the `___Scenes` directory within the editor and open the `_AlwaysLoaded` scene. Now when you press Play, it will handle the rest.
