## Introduction:

#### Goals and Features:

Human Space Program aims to create a realistic spaceflight game with hopefully a relatively low barrier of entry (comparatively speaking) that is easy to mod.

- **Free of Charge** - HSP is and will always be available for free for everyone!
- **Open Source** - Contribute to the project!

If you like games such as Kerbal Space Program or Juno: New Origins, you will also like this.

- **Real Scale Systems** - The Earth, the Solar System, and real world-sized rockets.
- **Modular Rockets** - Build rockets from parts, which themselves may consist of even more parts.
- **Highly Flexible** - Replace any system you want using mods.

## Installation:

#### Prebuilt Binaries:

You can download prebuilt binaries from the [releases section on GitHub](https://github.com/Katniss218/HumanSpaceProgram/releases). Download the appropriate file for your operating system, extract it, and run the executable to start playing.
There is no installation process - simply unzip and double-click on the executable. :D

#### Unity Editor:

If you prefer to build HSP from source or want to contribute to its development, you can follow the steps below.

**Prerequisites:**
- **Unity Editor** - Version 2022.1.8f1 (*as of 2025/05/03*). 
HSP will transition to Unity 6 sometime in the future.
- **Git or a Git client** - To clone the repository (optional).

**Running in the editor:**
1. Clone the repository or download as ZIP.
2. Download the Unity Editor:
    - Download and install Unity Hub from the [Unity website](https://unity.com/download).
    - Use Unity Hub to download the Unity Editor version specified above.
3. Press the `Add` button and locate the `HumanSpaceProgram` directory. Note that it is *not* the root directory, but one level deeper.
4. Once the Unity Editor finishes loading, navigate to the `___Scenes` directory within the editor and double-click the `_AlwaysLoaded` scene to open it. 
5. Now when you press Play, it will handle the rest.

**Building from source:**
1. Clone the repository or download as ZIP.
2. Download the Unity Editor:
    - Download and install Unity Hub from the [Unity website](https://unity.com/download).
    - Use Unity Hub to download the Unity Editor version specified above.
3. Press the `Add` button and locate the `HumanSpaceProgram` directory. Note that it is *not* the root directory, but one level deeper.
4. Once the Unity Editor finishes loading, go to `File > Build Settings`, select your operating system and CPU architecture, and press `Build`.
5. Once Unity finishes the build process, copy the `HumanSpaceProgram/GameData` directory inside the build folder.
6. Now you can double-click the `HumanSpaceProgram.exe` and launch the game.
